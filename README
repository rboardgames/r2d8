When run the bot creates two sqlite databases, one for BGG URL queries and one for keeping track of comments and responses. The default names are:

    UID-bot.db - the comment database
    UID-bgg.db - the BGG access cache database

where UID is the UID of the bot, usually "r2d8". 

Currently the bot acknowledges ^C, but does not exit. One consume thread is not dying for some reason.

Requirements:
 - PRAW 5.0
 - boardgamegeek
 - sqlite3 (included in most distributions, I think.)

To authorize this, you need to add keys from the app creation into the file specified in r2d8_oauth.py

Former people who've ran this bot will have those keys until you regenerate them. 

When you run it, use ./r2_supervisor.sh to make it more resilent to dying. 

If it dies, this will restart it.

To kill this app's process, (as you need to do when you update the code), type 

      ps -aux|grep artoodeeeight.py

then type the number that appears in the second column.

To kill the supervisor, do the same thing with the name of the supervisor program, then kill the app's process
