When run the bot creates two sqlite databases, one for BGG URL queries and one for keeping track of comments and responses. The default names are:

    UID-bot.db - the comment database
    UID-bgg.db - the BGG access cache database

where UID is the UID of the bot, usually "r2d8". 

Currently the bot acknowledges ^C, but does not exit. One consume thread is not dying for some reason.

Requirements:
 - PRAW 5.0
 - boardgamegeek
 - sqlite3 (included in most distributions, I think.)

To authorize this, you need to add keys from the app creation into the file specified in r2d8_oauth.py

Former people who've ran this bot will have those keys until you regenerate them.
